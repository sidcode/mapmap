Because of that, all small businesses should be community owned. Tokenization is the easiest way to accomplish this on a massive scale.",

        "Project Description":"VoizDAO is sense-making community led by college students that mobilizes for a livable planet. We exist to hold our institutions accountable, guide investors and consumers, and coordinate collective action on a mass scale. We recognize that incremental progress on climate and social justice is falling way short, and we seek to replace the failed, dominant narrative of sustainability with a solarpunk, regenerative one. We exist IRL on college campuses and have drawn 450 members from over 50 schools in the UK and U.S.. Our main outputs are sustainable investment (fka ESG) ratings, product sustainability ratings, peer-to-peer climate and sustainability education, summits, and solarpunk NFTs. We plan to roll out the first solarpunk \"crypto ESG\" index later this year.",
